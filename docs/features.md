## Core Concepts

### What is a Pop Note?

A **Pop Note** is a quick-access note that opens in a separate floating window. Think of it as a digital sticky note that:
- Can be summoned instantly from anywhere on your computer
- Stays separate from your main Obsidian workspace
- Persists your thoughts without disrupting your workflow

### Key Benefits

1. **Non-intrusive**: Pop notes don't interfere with your main Obsidian window
2. **Always Available**: Access from any application using global hotkeys
3. **Persistent**: Notes are saved automatically and can be accessed later
4. **Organized**: All pop notes are stored in a dedicated folder

## Global Hotkey System

### What is a Global Hotkey?

A global hotkey is a keyboard shortcut that works **system-wide**, meaning it responds even when Obsidian is minimized or hidden behind other applications.

### Global Hotkey

The global hotkey can be customized in the plugin settings.

### How It Works

1. Press the hotkey from any application
2. If a PopNote window exists, it appears instantly
3. If no window exists, a new one is created
4. The window gains focus, ready for input

### Customizing the Global Hotkey

1. Go to Settings â†’ PopNote
2. Find "Global Hotkey" section
3. Click in the hotkey field
4. Press your desired key combination

**Available Modifiers:**
- `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd` (macOS)
- `Alt` (Windows/Linux) or `Option` (macOS) 
- `Shift`
- `CmdOrCtrl` (automatically uses Cmd on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere)

**Valid Examples:**
- `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+P`
- `Alt+Shift+N`
- `Ctrl+Alt+Space`

**Important:** Choose a combination not used by your operating system or other applications.

## Pop Note Creation

### Buffer Time System

The buffer time determines whether pressing the global hotkey creates a new note or reuses a recent one.

#### Buffer Time Options

1. **Always Create New Note**
   - Every hotkey press creates a fresh note
   - Best for: Users who want separate notes for each thought
   - Risk: May create many small notes

2. **Always Reuse Last Note**
   - Always opens the most recent pop note
   - Best for: Maintaining a single "capture" note
   - Risk: May mix unrelated content

3. **Custom Time (Minutes)**
   - Reuses the last note if created within X minutes
   - Configurable in minutes
   - Best for: Capturing related thoughts in bursts
   - Example: Set to 30 minutes for meeting notes

### Note Naming Patterns

Customize how your pop notes are named using variables:

#### Available Variables

- `{{date}}` - Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `{{time}}` - Current time (HH-mm-ss)
- `{{year}}` - 4-digit year
- `{{month}}` - 2-digit month
- `{{day}}` - 2-digit day
- `{{hour}}` - 2-digit hour (24-hour format)
- `{{minute}}` - 2-digit minute
- `{{second}}` - 2-digit second

#### Pattern Examples

- `PopNote {{date}} {{time}}` â†’ "PopNote 2024-01-15 14-30-45"
- `Quick Thought {{date}}` â†’ "Quick Thought 2024-01-15"
- `Meeting {{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}` â†’ "Meeting 2024-01-15"

### Template Support

Templates let you start new pop notes with predefined content.

#### Setting Up Templates

1. Create a template file in your vault
2. Go to Settings â†’ PopNote
3. Click "Select" next to "Template file"
4. Choose your template

- Cursor positions are preserved

### Integration with Obsidian Features

Pop notes are regular Obsidian files, so they support:
- Backlinks and tags

### Performance Optimization

#### Hide/Show Pattern
Instead of destroying windows, PopNote hides them. This provides:
- Instant window appearance
- Lower CPU usage
- Better responsiveness

#### Smart File Loading
- Only loads files when needed
- Caches cursor positions
- Minimal memory footprint

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Global Hotkey Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
1. Another application uses the same hotkey
2. Hotkey contains invalid combination
3. Obsidian lacks system permissions

**Solutions:**
1. Try a different key combination
2. Ensure hotkey has actual keys (not just modifiers)
3. Check system accessibility permissions

#### Window Not Appearing

**Possible Causes:**
1. Window is hidden off-screen
2. Window is minimized
3. Multiple monitor setup issues

**Solutions:**
1. Change window position to "Center" in settings
2. Restart Obsidian
3. Disable and re-enable the plugin

#### Notes Not Saving

**Possible Causes:**
1. Invalid folder path
2. File permissions issues
3. Sync conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. Check PopNotes folder exists
2. Verify write permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to troubleshoot issues:

1. Settings â†’ PopNote â†’ Developer Settings
2. Toggle "Debug mode"
3. Check developer console for detailed logs

## Best Practices

### Workflow Tips

1. **Daily Capture**: Set buffer time to "permanent" for a daily scratch pad
2. **Meeting Notes**: Use custom buffer time (30-60 minutes)
3. **Quick References**: Pin frequently used notes
4. **Project Notes**: Use specific naming patterns per project

### Performance Tips

1. **Folder Cleanup**: Periodically archive old pop notes
2. **Template Efficiency**: Keep templates lightweight
3. **Window Management**: Use "remember last position" for consistency

### Organization Tips

1. **Naming Conventions**: Include project prefixes in patterns
